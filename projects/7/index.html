This method provides smooth and quiet motor operation, which is particularly valuable in gimbal systems where jitter and vibration can compromise camera stability. FOC also delivers high precision in positioning, making it ideal for maintaining accurate orientation in the presence of external disturbances. Additionally, it improves energy efficiency by applying only the necessary current, reducing power consumption and heat buildup—key benefits for compact, battery-powered UAV payloads.

This step was critical for catching wiring or configuration issues early in a controlled environment.\"},{\"src\":\"/Canadian_UAS/avionics_power_on.mp4\",\"title\":\"Internal Wiring\",\"description\":\"This image shows the internal electrical system being added to the mechanical assembly for a test fit. The goal was to verify cable lengths, connector alignment with external panels, and overall layout before final integration. Since much of the wiring and power distribution needed to be in place before gluing the carbon fiber skin over the internal structure, this step was critical. Full system testing at this stage ensured that everything would be accessible and functional after final assembly.\"},{\"src\":\"/Canadian_UAS/glue_fues.jpeg?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"Semi-Monocoque Fuselage\",\"description\":\"The mechanical team, led by Mateo, chose a semi-monocoque design to significantly increase the structural rigidity of the airframe. While effective, the gluing process for this design proved to be extremely challenging. The epoxy had a one-hour set time, and both the internal structure and carbon fiber skin had to be glued in a single attempt to ensure proper alignment. To achieve this, all components were clamped together using the same molds that had been used for the carbon fiber layups.\"},{\"src\":\"/Canadian_UAS/wing_assem.jpeg?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"Wing Assembly\",\"description\":\"The wings were assembled using a similar process, built around two large carbon fiber wing spars and laser-cut wooden ribs for structural support. Telemetry and airspeed sensor cables were routed through the internal structure during assembly and glued into place to ensure secure and clean integration. This approach allowed the wings to maintain a lightweight yet rigid construction. Careful planning was required to ensure all internal components were positioned correctly before final bonding.\"},{\"src\":\"/Canadian_UAS/all_together.mp4\",\"title\":\"A Complete Aircraft\",\"description\":\"A look at the fully assembled aircraft, showcasing the completed airframe with wings attached and all internal components integrated. The design features a sleek, aerodynamic profile with the carbon fiber skin providing both strength and weight savings. The aircraft is now ready for final system checks and flight testing, marking a significant milestone in the project.\"},{\"src\":\"/Canadian_UAS/wingless_flight_test.mp4\",\"title\":\"Initial Flight Test\",\"description\":\"Intitially, we conducted flight tests without the wings to validate the flight control system and ensure stable operation. This approach allowed us to focus on tuning the quadcopter's flight characteristics without the added complexity of wing aerodynamics. The test was successful, demonstrating that the core flight control algorithms were functioning as intended and that the aircraft could maintain stable hover and controlled flight.\"},{\"src\":\"/Canadian_UAS/crash.jpeg?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"Maiden Flight Crash\",\"description\":\"This picture shows the damage sustained during our first transition test, which ended in a significant crash. The failure was caused by strong gusts that introduced external disturbances, ultimately leading to a stall mid-transition. In hindsight, we should not have flown that day—wind conditions were unfavorable, but the pressure of limited testing time before team members left for the summer influenced the decision. The combination of a tight timeline and fatigue led to poor judgment on my part, and it’s a mistake I’ve taken seriously and will not repeat.\"},{\"src\":\"/Canadian_UAS/repair.jpeg?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"Sleepless Repair\",\"description\":\"After the crash, extensive repairs were required in the weeks leading up to the competition to salvage the work we had put in over the year. One of our team members, Sam Williamson, stayed at my house during this period to help with the rebuild. The process involved many late nights, as we worked to restore the aircraft while also managing full-time job commitments. The resulting sleep deprivation was intense and unlike anything I had experienced before, but it was a necessary push to get the project flight-ready in time.\"},{\"src\":\"/Canadian_UAS/post_crash_test.mp4\",\"title\":\"Post-Crash Testing\",\"description\":\"This video captures a flight test conducted in Nova Scotia following the crash and subsequent repair efforts. It shows the aircraft back in the air, successfully completing basic maneuvers and demonstrating that critical systems—flight control, power distribution, and structural integrity—had been restored. The flight marked a major milestone in confirming the effectiveness of the repairs made under tight time and resource constraints. It was a reassuring moment for the team, proving that the project could still move forward despite the earlier setback.\"},{\"src\":\"/Canadian_UAS/competition.jpeg?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"Competition Day\",\"description\":\"The competition was an incredible experience, offering the chance to see how other teams approached the same problem with different design philosophies and technical strategies. It was both humbling and inspiring to observe the ingenuity, as well as the surprising similarities, across various solutions. Being surrounded by like-minded individuals who shared a passion for UAV design and problem-solving created a collaborative and motivating atmosphere.\"},{\"src\":\"/Canadian_UAS/runway.jpeg?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"Lessons Learned\",\"description\":\"This project taught me the importance of sound judgment under pressure—rushing flight tests in poor weather due to time constraints led to avoidable failure. It reinforced the value of thorough pre-integration testing, like iron bird setups and load testing, which help catch critical issues before final assembly. Working on my first PCB highlighted how essential good layout practices and serviceability features are, especially for power systems. I also learned that simulation alone is not enough; many issues only become apparent during physical testing. Above all, the experience underscored the importance of collaboration, as the project could not have been salvaged without the dedication and support of teammates during intense repair efforts.\"}],\"teamMembers\":[\"Co-Captain – Grant Keefe\",\"Co-Captain – Ryan Berry\",\"Perception – Conor Spalvieri\",\"Avionics, Firmware – Ian Keefe\",\"Navigation – Gabe David\",\"Aerodynamics \u0026 Propulsion – William Conway\",\"Structures \u0026 Manufacturing – Mateo Schwartz-Mendez\",\"CAD Wizard - James Gullberg\",\"Aerodynamics Wizard - Sam Williamson\"]},{\"id\":9,\"title\":\"Internatioanal Micro Air Vehicles Competition\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"/IMAV/Competition_team.jpg?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"The Team\",\"description\":\"\"},{\"src\":\"/IMAV/drone_bottom.png?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"Final Design\",\"description\":\"\"},{\"src\":\"/IMAV/half_built.jpeg?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"Assembly in Progress\",\"description\":\"\"},{\"src\":\"/IMAV/line_follow.mp4\",\"title\":\"Initial Line Following Sim\",\"description\":\"\"},{\"src\":\"/IMAV/lines_with_noise.png?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"Noisy Floors\",\"description\":\"\"},{\"src\":\"/IMAV/test_sim.png?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"Full Lap Simulation\",\"description\":\"\"},{\"src\":\"/IMAV/air-bnb-test.jpeg?height=400\u0026width=600\",\"title\":\"Last minute testing\",\"description\":\"\"}],\"teamMembers\":[\"Grant Keefe\",\"Ryan Berry\",\"Conor Spalvieri\",\"Ian Keefe\",\"Gabe David\"]}],\"pdfProjectId\":7,\"pdfUrl\":\"/Semi-Autonomous/robotics_paper.pdf\"}],\"$undefined\",null,[\"$\",\"$L6\",null,{\"children\":[\"$L7\",\"$L8\",null]}]]}],{},null,false]},null,false]},null,false]},null,false],[\"$\",\"$1\",\"h\",{\"children\":[null,[\"$\",\"$1\",\"d5tjNlEKdAF5NGshEaGz5\",{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L9\",null,{\"children\":\"$La\"}],null]}],[\"$\",\"$Lb\",null,{\"children\":\"$Lc\"}]]}],false]],\"m\":\"$undefined\",\"G\":[\"$d\",\"$undefined\"],\"s\":false,\"S\":true}\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"5:{\"id\":\"7\"}\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"a:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"viewport\",\"content\":\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"}]]\n7:null\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"8:null\nc:[[\"$\",\"title\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"v0 App\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"Created with v0\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"2\",{\"name\":\"generator\",\"content\":\"v0.dev\"}]]\n"])</script></body></html>
